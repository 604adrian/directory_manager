# Directory Manager
A CLI directory manager. It is nothing fancy. Everything it can do you can already probably do with your preferred shell language. But it looks flashier than any shell language (even if it's FISH).

I am making this repository with the aim of better understanding how to use nodejs to make a CLI and how to post a package to npm. I am following the tutorial on the other end of this url: <https://blog.logrocket.com/building-typescript-cli-node-js-commander/>
